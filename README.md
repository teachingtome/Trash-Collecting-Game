# Trash-Collecting-Game
A simple trash collection game

Our project is a fun game that raises awareness about littering and polluting. The player collects bottles around the map and brings it to a trash can. The player can then spend the bottles on jump and speed upgrades. The player wins after 110/150 bottles are collected and brings them to an end screen, displaying a message to encourage them to collect trash in real life. Music plays in the background and sound effects play whenever the player collects or throws away trash.

Controls:
WASD to move.
Spacebar to jump.
Left CTRL to crouch/slide.
P and O to upgrade Speed and Jump.
